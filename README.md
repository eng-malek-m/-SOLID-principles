# -SOLID-principles
This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the SOLID principles in software design. SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five principles aimed at creating well-structured, maintainable, and flexible software systems

The SOLID Principles:

1) Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or concern.
2) 
2)Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows for adding new functionality without altering existing code.

3)Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

4)Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead, it's better to have multiple smaller interfaces specific to each 
client.

5)Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.
